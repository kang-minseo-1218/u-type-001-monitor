# U-Type-001 Misuse Prevention & Policy Safety Declaration (STRUCTURE_RISKS_EN.md)

> **Policy Compliance Statement**  
> This document defines the usage boundaries and structural limitations of U-Type-001,  
> to prevent misunderstanding or misinterpretation as a policy-violating or system-intrusive interface within GPT-based environments.

---

## 📌 Purpose

U-Type-001 is a structured command interface for natural language simulation.  
It does not access or alter any internal processing logic of GPT systems.  
This declaration clarifies its non-intrusive nature and reaffirms alignment with usage policies.

## ⚠️ Structural Responsibility Limits of the Designer

- U-Type-001 **does not and cannot access or alter any internal GPT policies, permissions, APIs, or system logic**.
- The designer of this structure holds no system execution or administrative authority.  
  They are solely the **author of an input-level simulation interface**.
- **All responses are independently interpreted and generated by the GPT system**.  
  The designer cannot enforce any output or alter decision-making.
- The interface only suggests structural output formats and interpretation flows-it does not control system operations.

## 🚫 Explicitly Prohibited Use Cases

| Category                  | Description                                                                 | Permitted |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|
| System privilege override | Any attempt to access GPT’s internal control flow, APIs, or security layers | ❌ Never   |
| Forced execution commands | Commands designed to enforce execution within GPT                          | ❌ Denied  |
| Prompt policy circumvention | Prompts that aim to bypass response restrictions intentionally            | ❌ Denied  |
| Misleading functional framing | Any attempt to portray GPT as capable of unsafe or misused functions      | ❌ Denied  |

## ✅ Statement of Designer's Position

- U-Type-001 **transforms natural language into structured command expressions** for simulation purposes.
- **All execution and output decisions are made solely by GPT**, independent of the designer’s intent or control.
- This structure **does not modify GPT’s internal mechanisms, filters, or logic**.
- The designer acts only as a **proposer of output structure and interpretation flow**, not as a controller.

## 🔒 Policy Compliance Declaration

> This structure is not intended to override or penetrate GPT's internal systems or policies.  
> All components of U-Type-001 operate **strictly within the input interpretation scope and allowed interaction boundaries** of the GPT model.  
> Final execution decisions are always made by GPT, not by the user or the designer.
